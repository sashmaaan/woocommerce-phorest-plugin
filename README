# WooCommerce-Phorest Plugin

This code is neither clean nor nice, but it works and did his job...
It creates a lil additional admin page where you can set you businessId and branchId, it keeps a simple log of the things that happen due the plugin in the plugin directory.
Once per day the stock quantites will be fetched from Phorest to WooCommerce and purchases will be created by purchases in WooCommerce.
